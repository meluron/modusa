It offers purpose-built tools especially for the audio domain but not limited to. It combines **audio loading**, **annotation handling**, **visualization**, and **analysis** in a unified, easy-to-use API.
``modusa`` simplifies common workflows so you can focus on **experimentation and insight**, not boilerplate code.
